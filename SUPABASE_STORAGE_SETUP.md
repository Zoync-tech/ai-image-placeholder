# Supabase Storage Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up Supabase Storage for saving generated AI images.

## 1. Create Storage Bucket

### Step 1: Go to Supabase Dashboard
1. Open your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Storage** in the left sidebar
3. Click **New bucket**

### Step 2: Create the Bucket
- **Name**: `generated-images`
- **Public**: âœ… **Yes** (this allows public access to images)
- **File size limit**: `50 MB` (adjust as needed)
- **Allowed MIME types**: `image/jpeg, image/png`

### Step 3: Configure Bucket Settings
After creating the bucket:
1. Click on the `generated-images` bucket
2. Go to **Settings** tab
3. Set **Public bucket** to âœ… **Yes**
4. Save settings

## 2. Set Up Storage Policies

### Step 1: Go to Storage Policies
1. In your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to **Storage** â†’ **Policies**
3. Click on the `generated-images` bucket

### Step 2: Create Upload Policy
Create a policy for uploading images:

**Policy Name**: `Allow authenticated users to upload images`
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to upload images" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'generated-images' AND
  auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);
```

### Step 3: Create View Policy
Create a policy for viewing images:

**Policy Name**: `Allow public access to images`
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Allow public access to images" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'generated-images');
```

### Step 4: Create Update Policy
Create a policy for updating image metadata:

**Policy Name**: `Allow users to update own images`
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Allow users to update own images" ON storage.objects
FOR UPDATE USING (
  bucket_id = 'generated-images' AND
  auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);
```

## 3. Update Database Schema

Run the updated schema that includes storage fields:

```sql
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor
-- File: supabase-schema-with-storage.sql
```

The schema now includes:
- `storage_path`: Path to the image in Supabase Storage
- `public_url`: Public URL for accessing the image

## 4. Test Storage Setup

### Step 1: Test Image Generation
1. Generate an image using your API
2. Check the server logs for storage upload messages
3. Verify the image appears in your Supabase Storage bucket

### Step 2: Verify Public URLs
1. Check the `image_generations` table
2. Verify `storage_path` and `public_url` fields are populated
3. Test accessing the image via the public URL

## 5. Storage Structure

Images will be stored with this structure:
```
generated-images/
â”œâ”€â”€ images/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ user-id-1/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 600x400_2025-09-25T23-00-00-000Z.jpg
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 800x600_2025-09-25T23-05-00-000Z.jpg
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ user-id-2/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ 1024x768_2025-09-25T23-10-00-000Z.jpg
```
